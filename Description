Description:A CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application is a fundamental software system that enables users to efficiently manage data.
This particular CRUD application incorporates several key features for enhanced functionality and security.

The application begins with a secure login page and a user-friendly signup page, both equipped with essential validation mechanisms.

To ensure secure user authentication, the application employs JSON Web Tokens (JWT), safeguarding sensitive information during login and enhancing overall security.
Once logged in, users are directed to a home page with a search bar, enabling them to search and filter data effectively. Users can also perform a range of CRUD operations on a data table, which includes 
adding new entries, reading existing data, updating entries, and deleting records when necessary.

In summary, this comprehensive CRUD application combines user authentication, data search capabilities, and robust data management functions to provide a secure and user-friendly experience.

Technology Stack: React, ExpressJs, NodeJs, MongoDB, JWT Token
